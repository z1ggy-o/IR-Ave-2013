out like the outside of a guitar school\\nThousand dollar frames I prefer to see the world through\\nDon\\'t ask me nothing \\'bout Budden, I beat my girl too\\nYou ask me why do I keep her, I say it\\'s cheaper to\\nThat\\'s why I ride around in a Rolls like Wiz Khalifa do\\nRappers I\\'m your daddy, I tell you straight as this\\nYou don\\'t kill but your father will like Jayden Smith\\nI tell you like I tell my Spanish chick\\nYou fly, but I ain\\'t going down on no landing strip\\nSo get your wax on like Daniel San\\nOr I\\'mma have to run like De la Hoya in drag when cameras come\\nPoint out the greatest rapper alive I head shot \\'em\\nSmack his girl on the butt and buy her some red bottom\\nBring every deceased rapper back to see his wife\\nWhile I\\'m cyber-sexing with Jessica Alba

Sky's the limit I'm paid to run the city now.\\n[Nas]:\\nYa skins ya traveling bag of your existence. Yours is shabby and scab while mines glistenin. Vivid on my skin how many continents I've visit then you could journey with me to different places by listenin. Shittin on em. Ya brutha got it covered we can slug it, knuckle it however you want I love it. A hustler's wit. The grit the grind. My genetic code make-up. Murderer by design. On my calendar time when night meets day. I'm in a light grey bugatti like a high-speed chase. Adrenaline like jogger the jump in rope in place. The Muhammad Ali hobbies no pilates trying to keep the ocean by me. Hit a rich man's wife see what these hoes can buy me. Lookin forward but it's nice to see the rode behind me. Hotel's a 7 star. Begets glowin. Keep ya lid yet dawg the private jet bowin topless.\\n[Chorus]:\\nCause ladies when I shine. Nigga wish quick. No startin I'm the shootin kind. Front page all the time. You boys think sick but I aint got no roof on mine. I drink Topless, I live Topless. Like my girl is the game with her titties out. I drink Topless, I live Topless.

       "  'yesterday-when-i-was-young': \"YESTERDAY WHEN I WAS YOUNG\\nWriters Charles Aznavour, Herbert Kretzmer\\nYesterday when I was young the taste of life was sweet as rain upon my tongue. I teased at life as if it were a foolish game, the way the evening breeze may tease a candle flame. The thousand dreams I dreamed, the splendid things I planned I always built alas on weak and shifting sand. I lived by night and shunned the naked light of the day and only now I see how the years ran away. Yesterday when I was young so many drinking songs were waiting to be sung, so many wayward pleasures lay in store for me and so much pain my dazzled eyes refused to see. I ran so fast that time and youth at last ran out, I never stopped to think what life was all about and every conversation I can now recall concerned itself with me and nothing else at all. Yesterday the moon was blue and every crazy day brought something new to do. I used my magic age as if it were a wand and never saw the waste and emptiness beyond. The game of love I played with arrogance and pride and every flame I lit too quickly quickly died. The friends I made all seemed somehow to drift away and only I am left on stage to end the play. There are so many songs in me that won't be sung; I feel the bitter taste of tears upon my tongue. The time has come for me to pay for yesterday when I was young.\",\n",
