## Working Environment

- Python: 3.72
- Numpy

## How to Use

Source codes in `src` directory, script files in `text` directory.

`lsi.py` and `term_doc_matrix.py` are modules, `search.py.` is the app file.
`docs_list.txt` contains the list of files.

Usage:
```shell
python3 searach.py docs_list.txt
```

The program may need few seconds to do the SVD, then it will ask for $k$ value.
