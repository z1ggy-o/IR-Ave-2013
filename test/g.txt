Well this is this and that is that
Though shrinks say they know better
But people making love says more
Than any word or letter

He's not too good with books and such 
No not too good with that  
But he's got knowledge nice and raw
And lots of nifty chat

Baby let me scream at you 
You can decline of course
I'm talking to your girlfriend 
Give me some chili sauce

Well this is this and that is that
Though shrinks say they know better
But people making love says more
Than any word or letter

She's not the subtle kind at all 
Don't give her life from books
But girls are girls are girls are girls
And boy she's got the looks

Get in get on get down get off 
Get up get dressed get out
And if you find a better way
Pick up the phone and shout 

Get in get on get down get off 
How fond of milk you are 
Don't be a Mrs. Hangup girl 
Beaucuop de Chocolat 

Baby let me scream at you 
You can decline of course
I'm talking to your girlfriend 
Give me some chili sauce

It's that moment when you know it
A first glance let's you show it
That something good will happen here tonight
And far across the room
So deep inside her spoon
You passions like a spear of true delight
 
Get in get on get down get off 
Get up get dressed get out
And if you find a better way
Pick up the phone and shout 

Get in get on get down get off 
How fond of milk you are 
Don't be a Mrs. Hangup girl
